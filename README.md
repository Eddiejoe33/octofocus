# OctoFocus – Task Management Web App

## Problem

- Automatically track tasks received in real-time.
- Helps users prioritize and stay focused.
- Reduces the chance of missing deadlines.

## How It Works
1. Open the web app (`index.html`) in a browser.
2. Add a task by entering its name, deadline, and estimated effort.
3. See tasks listed immediately on the page.
4. Tasks received are also printed in real-time in the backend terminal for tracking.
